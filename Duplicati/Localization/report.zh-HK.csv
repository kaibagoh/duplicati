 Duplicati uses filters to include and exclude files.
  Duplicati uses a ""first-touch"" filter where the first rule that matches a file determines if the file is included or excluded. Internally Duplicati uses regular expression filters, but supports filters in the form of filename globbing. The order of the commandline arguments also determine what order they are applied in. An example:
    --include=*.txt --exclude=*\Thumbs.db --include=*

  Even though the last filter includes everything, no files named ""Thumbs.db"" are included because they match the exclude rule before the include rule. Paths are evaluated in full, and as paths that are relative to folder being backed up, but including a leading slash. An example:

{0}
  If a folder is excluded, files in that folder are always excluded, even if there are filters that include files in that folder. If a folder is included with a wildcard at the end, all files are included, if the folder is included without a wildcard, files may be excluded or included with extra rules.",""
